# Final Cut Pro Scene Detector (fcpscene)

This program detects scene changes in videos and generates a Final Cut
Pro project file (FCPXML) with a timeline "bladed" at the scene changes.

For example, the timeline below has six clips (five cuts).

## Installation

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
2. In the Terminal app type:

```shell
brew tap ericfortis/fcpscene
brew install fcpscene
```


## Place your video in your üìÇ`Home` or üìÇ`Movies` directory
You video file should be in a directory Final Cut Pro can access. By default,
your üìÇ`Home` and üìÇ`Movies` directories are allowed. **Otherwise, grant Full-Disk
Access** to Final Cut Pro. If not, Final Cut will crash when importing the
`fcpxml` project &mdash; for example, if your video is in your ‚ö†Ô∏è _Desktop_, or
‚ö†Ô∏è _Documents_, or any other TCC-protected folder.



## Running
In the Terminal, type:

```shell
fcpscene-gui
```

A 15-minute 4K 60fps video takes about 1 minute to run on a 14-core M4. You‚Äôll
see the found cut times as it runs &mdash; if you hit "Stop and Save", a Final
Cut Pro project file with the cuts found so far will be saved üíæ.

The sensitivity should be around 65 to 90%. Start with 85% and increase it if
it‚Äôs missing cuts. By the way, 1-frame cuts are ignored regardless of the
percent. Also, the sensitivity doesn‚Äôt affect speed.

### Importing into Final Cut Pro
Double-click the generated `.fcpxml` file to import it.

Or, import it from Final Cut Pro: File &rarr; Import &rarr; XML &rarr;  Select the generated `.fcpxml`

<br>



## Or, Run the CLI

```shell
fcpscene ~/Desktop/my-video.mp4
```

In that example, an `~/Desktop/my-video.fcpxml` project will
be created. That is, in the same directory the video is in.

Tip: If you don‚Äôt want to type file paths, just drag the
file into the Terminal ‚Äî it will paste the path for you.


### Options

#### Sensitivity
Range: 0-100, Default: **85**

This value sets the frame difference percentage used to detect scene changes.

```shell
python3 scenes_to_fcp.py --sensitivity 70 my-video.mp4
```

#### Proxy Width
Default: **320**

Lower values speed up analysis. This sets the temporary width
used to scale down the video during processing. It does **not**
modify your original video, and the proxy version is never saved.

```shell
python3 scenes_to_fcp.py --proxy-width 240 my-video.mp4
```

### Tip: Batch Processing

In the Terminal, you can type a snippet like this to run `fcpscene` on all the
`.mp4` videos in your top-level üìÇ`~/Movies` directory. In other words, this
script will ignore videos in subdirectories.

```shell
cd ~/Movies
for vid in *.mp4; do
  caffeinate fcpscene "$vid"
done
```

Typing `caffeinate` is optional. It‚Äôs a macOS built-in program that prevents the
computer from sleeping while it‚Äôs running a task.

Also, keep your computer in a well ventilated area. `fcpscene` uses `ffmpeg`
behind the scenes, which will üî• max out your CPU cores.
